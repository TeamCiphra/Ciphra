##Week Two
This week the Jonathans worked on the items and the scene layout. The Jonathans moved all their images into the loader class from the previously insuffecient out file. we are currently in the process in transfering our single scene into multiple scenes. We also have started adding items/objects. There was also a massive interface update with button resizing and cleaner scene switching. 

The scecond week of 'Week Two' we overhalled the item bag and got to the point where the item bag keeps track of the number of items the player has per battle.  We tried doing this using javafx Tableview but moved to using a GridPane within a GridPane within a StackPane within a new Window to accomplish the task.  Also started using Hashmap gameStats to hold all data of the current game in mem.  We used Hashmap due to the nature of how it can call the value we need back by refering the the 'key' that we assigned when we added objects into the Hashmap.  Finally, we have started intergration with the Battle-Mech branch that Adam and Chris were working on.

To see work done by the members just check the number of commits in the "Commits" tab for each branch.

Thanks and HAGS.
