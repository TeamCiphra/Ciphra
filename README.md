##Week Two
This week the Jonathans worked on the items and the scene layout. The Jonathans moved all their images into the loader class from the previously insuffecient out file. we are currently in the process in transfering our single scene into multiple scenes. We also have started adding items/objects. There was also a massive interface update with button resizing and cleaner scene switching.
